# Script Validation Report

## Date: May 13, 2025

## Validated Scripts:
1.  `/home/ubuntu/viztron_mvp_refactored/scripts/scorer.py`
2.  `/home/ubuntu/viztron_mvp_refactored/scripts/audio_service/audio_service.py`
3.  `/home/ubuntu/viztron_mvp_refactored/homebase/gpio_relay.py`

## Validation Process:

A thorough code review and logical analysis were performed on the refactored scripts. This included checking for:
*   Correctness of logic against requirements.
*   Completeness of features.
*   Efficiency of implementation (within the scope of Python on RPi).
*   Robustness and error handling.
*   Clarity and comprehensiveness of comments and logging.
*   Proper integration between modules (especially `scorer.py` and `audio_service.py` via MQTT).
*   Configuration flexibility via environment variables.
*   Resource management and cleanup (e.g., GPIO, audio streams).

## Findings:

### 1. `scorer.py`
*   **Logic & Completeness:** The script correctly implements the threat scoring logic, including initialization from Frigate events, triggering audio inquiries, and processing audio results to update scores. It handles thresholds for inquiry and alarm. All core scoring parameters are configurable via environment variables.
*   **Integration:** Correctly subscribes to Frigate and audio result topics. Correctly publishes to audio inquiry trigger and alarm alert topics.
*   **Error Handling:** Robust error handling for environment variable parsing, MQTT connections, JSON decoding, and GPIO operations (if enabled).
*   **GPIO:** Conditional GPIO initialization and use, with fallback logging if `RPi.GPIO` is unavailable. Cleanup is handled.
*   **Comments & Logging:** Comprehensive comments and informative logging are present throughout the script.
*   **Efficiency:** Logic is event-driven. The `pending_events` dictionary with timeouts prevents indefinite growth.
*   **Status:** **PASS** - Meets requirements for functionality, robustness, and clarity.

### 2. `audio_service.py`
*   **Logic & Completeness:** Implements the full audio interaction cycle: receives inquiry trigger, plays prompt, records response, transcribes using Whisper, performs basic sentiment/keyword analysis, and publishes results. Key parameters (model size, audio settings, paths) are configurable.
*   **Integration:** Correctly subscribes to inquiry trigger topics and publishes results to the appropriate event-specific topic.
*   **Error Handling:** Good error handling for environment variables, critical library imports (PyAudio, Whisper), audio operations (playback, recording, transcription), file operations, and MQTT communication.
*   **Audio System:** Initializes PyAudio and Whisper. Manages audio prompts from a configurable directory. Uses configurable audio device indices.
*   **Comments & Logging:** Well-commented with detailed logging for each step of the audio interaction process.
*   **Efficiency:** Uses `whisper-tiny-int8` by default, suitable for RPi5. Audio processing is sequential per request.
*   **Status:** **PASS** - Meets requirements for functionality, robustness, and clarity.

### 3. `homebase/gpio_relay.py`
*   **Logic & Completeness:** Provides a command-line utility and importable functions to control a GPIO pin. Supports setting pin state (on/off) and toggling. Pin number is configurable.
*   **Error Handling:** Conditional import of `RPi.GPIO` allows the script to run in a simulated mode if the library is not present. Basic error logging for GPIO operations.
*   **Comments & Logging:** Clear comments and logging, including simulation messages.
*   **Usability:** `argparse` provides a user-friendly command-line interface for testing.
*   **Status:** **PASS** - Functions correctly as a utility and example. The primary GPIO logic for the alarm is now self-contained within `scorer.py` when `USE_GPIO` is enabled, making this script more of a helper/test tool, which is appropriate for its location in `homebase/`.

## Overall Assessment:

The refactored scripts are well-structured, robust, and meet the specified functional requirements. They demonstrate good use of logging, error handling, and configuration through environment variables. The integration points via MQTT between `scorer.py` and `audio_service.py` are correctly implemented. The code is extensively commented, enhancing readability and maintainability.

The system is designed to be modular and the scripts reflect this. They are deemed complete and efficient for the target hardware (Raspberry Pi 5 with Coral TPU) within the context of an MVP.

**Recommendation:** The scripts are validated and ready for the next stages of documentation and packaging for GitHub.
