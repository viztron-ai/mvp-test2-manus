[Service]
Type=simple
# This is a placeholder. Replace with your actual command to bring up the LTE connection.
# For example, using ModemManager and nmcli:
# ExecStartPre=/bin/sh -c 'while ! nmcli device status | grep -q "gsm.*connected"; do sleep 5; done'
ExecStart=/usr/bin/nmcli connection up your-lte-connection-name
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=30

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

# Notes:
# 1. Replace "your-lte-connection-name" with the actual name of your LTE network connection configured in NetworkManager.
# 2. You might need to install ModemManager and configure your LTE modem first.
# 3. Ensure your LTE modem (e.g., Quectel BG95) is supported and drivers are installed.
# 4. This service attempts to bring up the LTE connection if it's not already active or if the primary WAN fails (depending on routing metrics).
#    More sophisticated failover logic might involve monitoring the primary WAN and only activating LTE when it's down.
#    Consider using tools like `ifmetric` or configuring routing priorities.
#
# To use:
# 1. Edit this file with your specific commands and connection names.
# 2. Save it as /etc/systemd/system/lte-failover.service (without .example).
# 3. Run: sudo systemctl daemon-reload
# 4. Run: sudo systemctl enable lte-failover.service
# 5. Run: sudo systemctl start lte-failover.service
